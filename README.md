# 🛒 AI-Powered Shoplifting Detection System

 Domain - AIML
 Team- Team CoreX

## 📌 Problem Statement

Retail theft, particularly shoplifting, costs the global retail industry billions of dollars annually. Most small and medium-sized retailers lack access to real-time, intelligent surveillance systems that can proactively detect and alert on suspicious activities. Current CCTV systems are passive, relying on human monitoring or after-the-fact footage analysis, which is both time-consuming and ineffective.

## 💡 Our Approach & Solution

We propose an **AI-powered Shoplifting Detection System** that utilizes deep learning and computer vision to analyze CCTV footage in real-time and detect suspicious behaviors linked to shoplifting. This system can be integrated with existing surveillance infrastructure and provides instant alerts, thereby preventing loss and enhancing store security.

### Key Steps in Our Solution:
1. **Data Collection** – Simulated surveillance footage of shoplifting and normal activity.
2. **Preprocessing** – Extract video frames, resize, normalize, and prepare for model input.
3. **Model Training** – Train a custom CNN/LSTM hybrid model to classify sequences as "Shoplifting" or "Normal Activity".
4. **Flask API** – Serve predictions through a lightweight REST API.
5. **Frontend  ** – GUI for uploading footage and receiving results.

## 🚀 Features

- 🎯 **Real-Time Detection:** Detects shoplifting activity from CCTV video feeds.
- 🔔 **Instant Alerts:** Returns prediction with confidence score for immediate action.
- 🧠 **Deep Learning Powered:** Uses a pre-trained TensorFlow model.
- 📦 **Easy Integration:** REST API built with Flask, deployable on-premises or in the cloud.
- 🔐 **Secure Access (optional):** Can be extended with API key-based access.
- 💻 **Cross-Platform:** Compatible with web, desktop, or mobile frontends.
